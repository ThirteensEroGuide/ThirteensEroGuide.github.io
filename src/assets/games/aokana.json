    "description": "This game has a surprisingly decent anime: https://anilist.co/anime/21319/Ao-no-Kanata-no-Four-Rhythm<br><br>Believe me when I say that you'll want flying shoes after playing this game. Also Misaki best girl.<br>AoKana is probably the most vanilla you can get in this list. Set on some random-ass island in Japan, you become the trainer of a few school girls participating in a sport called \"Flying Circus\". Of course the characters have to wear skimpy body suits, because yes. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)<br>Overall the game is pretty wholesome, the characters are neat, good humor, alright MC. Tl;dr: Go for it."
