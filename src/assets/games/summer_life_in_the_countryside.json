    "description": "Dieselmine does it again, this time with drop-dead gorgeous artwork and a soothing atmosphere. I don't think I have to explain much about the essence of this game. It really isn't anything special on the gameplay side of things, you essentially just walk around and explore the countryside while improving your relation with your cousin whose parents are away during summer vacation by interacting with her, gradually unlocking H-scenes and whatnot.<br>And just in case you were worried about the time management aspect of this game, it's nothing more but a small gimmick. There really is more than enough time to see everything, and even if you should run out, you can just start a New Game+ and carry over all your progress after the 30 days are over. Though, the fact it had to be a cousin is still a bit weird to me, and not because I am weirded out or anything, but rather because it's barely ever mentioned but at the start of the game. So if you can overlook that (or are even into that), I guarantee you'll have a nice time."
