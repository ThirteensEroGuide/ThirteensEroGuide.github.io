You cannot switch between the two.<br><br>Basically Madoka Magica as (actual) gacha-game with R18 scenes. You gather a team of highschool students that can turn into magical girls by kissing their phone. The battles themselves are pretty typical RPG stuff in a 3D environment paired with catchy music. Give it a shot if you like magical girls."
