    "description": "(Use NTLea to get rid of weird formatting issues as mentioned in the guide. The formatting issues aren't game breaking by any means though.)<br><br>The first Milky Quest game is about 3-4h long and is basically you getting isekai'ed into some random world, proceeded by running around and fucking monster girls. Of course there is some sort of story present in the background, but honestly, just enjoy the game."
