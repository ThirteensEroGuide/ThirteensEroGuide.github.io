    "description": "After Vampire Survivors, Magical Survival and HoloCure here comes the next (pretty lewd) entry in that genre - DaiSenka. Though, don't get me wrong, it's actually pretty enjoyable. You play as one of 5 unlockable female characters and fight yourself through hordes of knights and monsters. The number of H-scenes is on the lower side with about 5 rape scenes in case of defeat (one for each character) and 5 \"regular\" ones, so about 10 in total. So in case you want some fun for 2-3h (or more if you do end up enjoying it), give it a go."
