Ryuugames is pretty safe, but I still suggest you to run a virus scan on the downloaded file just in case.<br><br>Mahjong Connect is a PriConne (Princess Connect Re:Dive) mahjong parody game with H-scenes as reward. It's pretty self-explanatory, but you essentially fight against characters and have special abilities that spice the game up a bit. The developers also have some FGO parody games, as well as a game with dragon girls (and I believe a GBF one?), but I haven't played them yet so I can't comment on those."
