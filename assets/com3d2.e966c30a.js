It also contains a built-in auto-translator from JP to EN, and quite some community mods/assets. The guide is fairly long, so make sure you have enough time to properly read everything as it will take you a few hours.

(Also, in the Step 0 section, go with Alternative #1)<br><br>COM3D2 is the remastered version of KISS' previous game CM3D2. It is optically mostly the same (with some minor improvements here and there), but they changed up the story line and ported it to a new engine, and as most CM3D2 models can be imported into COM3D2, there is little to no reason to stick with the old game. The community is absolutely amazing as well, so I highly suggest heading over to the Custom Maid Discord Server (https://discord.gg/custommaid) if you're interested in modelling characters from other games.<br><br>In COM3D2 you inherit an adult maid caf\xE9 that offers special services to its customers. While there is a story in the game, the by far strongest aspect is the extensive modelling and the so-called "Yotogi" mode, in which you can diddle your maids to your hearts content and unlock further positions, interactions and stages as you become more intimate with them. Every maid also has so-called maid events in which you can either go down a "True Lovers" route or an "NTR" (cuckolding) route (you can also freely ignore both of them, nothing will happen). In any case, if you have a free day and the patience to read through yet another guide, give this a go.`,u={id:e,name:t,url:o,tags:s,stags:a,images:i,date:n,lang:r,censored:d,status:l,dev:h,dl:m,description:c};export{d as censored,n as date,u as default,c as description,h as dev,m as dl,e as id,i as images,r as lang,t as name,a as stags,l as status,s as tags,o as url};
