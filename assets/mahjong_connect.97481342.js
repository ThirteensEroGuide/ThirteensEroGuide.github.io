It's pretty self-explanatory, but you essentially fight against characters and have special abilities that spice the game up a bit. The developers also have some FGO parody games, as well as a game with dragon girls (and I believe a GBF one?), but I haven't played them yet so I can't comment on those.`,d={id:a,name:e,url:t,tags:s,stags:n,images:o,date:c,lang:i,censored:l,status:r,dev:g,dl:h,description:m};export{l as censored,c as date,d as default,m as description,g as dev,h as dl,a as id,o as images,i as lang,e as name,n as stags,r as status,s as tags,t as url};
