Though, don't get me wrong, it's actually pretty enjoyable. You play as one of 5 unlockable female characters and fight yourself through hordes of knights and monsters. The number of H-scenes is on the lower side with about 5 rape scenes in case of defeat (one for each character) and 5 "regular" ones, so about 10 in total. So in case you want some fun for 2-3h (or more if you do end up enjoying it), give it a go.`,m={id:e,name:a,url:t,tags:s,stags:n,images:o,date:r,lang:i,censored:c,status:d,dev:g,dl:l,description:u};export{c as censored,r as date,m as default,u as description,g as dev,l as dl,e as id,o as images,i as lang,a as name,n as stags,d as status,s as tags,t as url};
