As you progress through the five or so stages, the more you submit yourself to your enemies, the kinkier the main character of this game - Eris - will become. Compared to 'Ayura Crisis', the battles feel a lot smoother as in this game the main character has two different combat modes, a scythe and a gun mode, allowing you to freely switch between the two.
